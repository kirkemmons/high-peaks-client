# Application Title: A Description

This full stack application is designed for users to keep track of each and every Adirondack High Peak they have hiked.

Once a user has signed up and/or signed in, the user can add a peak that they have hiked. The user can also update or delete each park. They can also change password and sign out at the bottom of the page.
